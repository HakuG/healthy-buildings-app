## Next steps / To Do

* Refine data visuals with increased user interaction
* See summary of how a building is performing from buildings dashboard page
* Connect front end to real-time data sources
* Create admin side of web page, who can see all user data, requests, etc. and connect buildings to their data inputs
* Inclusion of Three.js for a 3d representation of data within the building
